# MCPs for Amateur Radio

A guide to **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for Amateur Radio development**—focused on helping non-programmers and developers build VHF/UHF/SHF and EME Amateur Radio software and websites with modern AI workflows.

## Overview

This repository provides:

- **A curated list of MCP servers** useful for key Amateur Radio software tasks.
- **Configuration guides** for using popular IDEs & tools (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Visual Studio).
- **Resources and tutorials** for learning and troubleshooting MCP setups.
- **Configuration file locations** for quick setup across different platforms.

> **Who is this for?**  
Amateur Radio operators and project builders who want to:
- Automate logging, station control, and EME scheduling.
- Integrate real-time propagation and mapping data into their workflow.
- Use AI to enhance problem solving (antenna design, propagation calculations, contact/band tracking).

## Features

- **Recommended MCP Servers**  
  Practical breakdown of which servers to use for:
  - Local files and log management (Filesystem)
  - Complex radio/antenna calculations (Sequential Thinking)
  - Persistent memory of passes/QSOs/configs (Memory)
  - Web & data integrations (Brave Search, Fetch, Google Maps, SQLite, GitHub)

- **Quickstart guides for IDE integration:**  
  Step-by-step setup for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and Visual Studio.

- **Universal and tool-specific resource links**  
  Including the official MCP spec, directories, and documentation for connecting servers.

- **Easy lookup of config file locations**  
  For all supported platforms and tools.
